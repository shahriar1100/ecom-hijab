# Storefront verification

Verified locally on 2026-10-09 with Node.js 22.17, Next.js 16.4, and headless Google Chrome.

## Navigation update

`npm run check:navigation` passed on `/` and `/shop` in light and dark themes at 320, 390, 768, 834, 1024 and 1440px (24 combinations), with no unexpected console or runtime errors.

- Mobile/tablet header contains the logo, Search and Menu; desktop navigation, theme switch and cart remain visible only at their existing desktop breakpoints.
- Bottom navigation is Home, Shop, Saved, Bag and Account, with the active route marked and Bag's quantity retained. Footer clearance exceeds 20px at maximum scroll; bottom and horizontal safe-area padding is included.
- Home, Shop All and all five category links navigate correctly and close the menu. All unbuilt destinations announce Coming soon inside the drawer.
- Initial focus, Tab/Shift+Tab wrapping, keyboard category expansion, Escape, backdrop, Close and focus restoration passed. Background wheel scrolling is blocked while open and unlocked after closing.
- Theme switching by keyboard and pointer, saved preference after reload and desktop/menu state consistency passed. Reduced-motion mode disables the slide animation.
- A short 834×390 landscape viewport can scroll the expanded menu while keeping Close and the theme control reachable. Resizing to desktop closes the drawer and restores focus to the logo.
- Axe found no WCAG 2 A/AA or 2.1 AA violations in expanded drawers with Coming soon feedback at 390 and 834px, in both themes. Light/dark drawer, mobile header/bottom navigation and desktop captures were visually reviewed.

The existing homepage and shop browser suites also passed after this update, along with ESLint, TypeScript and the production build. Screenshots and reports are in the ignored `output/navigation-qa/` folder. Existing pages, product data and image files were preserved; no routes or backend features were added.

## Shop phase

The new route is `/shop`; the homepage's design, photos, section order and product selections are preserved. No new images or dependencies were added. The catalogue has 28 typed local demo products, shared with homepage selections, and all image URLs remain in the data layer. The complete shop browser suite passed against the production build on local port 3100, with no unexpected console or runtime errors.

Run `npm run check:shop` against a running local server (`PREVIEW_URL` selects a different URL). Shop screenshots and reports are in the ignored `output/shop-qa/` folder. Full-page captures show fixed navigation at the original viewport edge; maximum-scroll measurements verify footer clearance. These are local demo interactions, with no backend, cart, checkout, authentication or product-detail routes.

## Homepage and theme checks

Raw reports and screenshots are in the ignored local `output/qa/` folder. Full-page screenshots show the fixed bottom navigation at the original viewport edge; separate footer screenshots and clearance measurements verify that all footer content is reachable and visible above the navigation.

The 15 pre-existing local placeholder photos are unchanged in the footer/theme update. No new pictures were created; future work must use provided or existing images unless image generation is explicitly requested. Prices, bag count, static sale countdown and contacts are demo data.

The production dependency audit is clean. npm currently reports five advisory entries in the development-only Next ESLint dependency chain (`braces` / `micromatch` / `fast-glob`); npm's suggested fix would downgrade Next's lint configuration across major versions and was not applied. ESLint 9 is retained to satisfy the current Next lint plugins' peer ranges.
