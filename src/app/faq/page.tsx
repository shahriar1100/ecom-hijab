      {
        q: "How can I track my order status?",

        q: "Which hijab fabric is best for hot and humid weather?",
        a: "Our Premium Modal hijabs (180 × 70 cm) are spun from breathable beechwood fibers that feel cool against the skin, making them our #1 bestseller for Bangladesh's warm climate.",

        q: "Are NOOR hijabs see-through?",
        a: "Our Jersey and Chiffon hijabs offer 95–100% opacity with a single wrap. Our featherlight Modal and Silk hijabs are 90% opaque and completely opaque when draped or worn with an undercap.",

      {
        q: "Will pins damage my modal or silk hijab?",

        q: "Can I exchange a hijab if the shade doesn't suit me?",

      },
      {
        q: "Can I access my account and order history from a different phone or laptop?",
